# Deterministic receipt-aware TypeScript product release root.
#
# A receipt content-addresses the binary that measured it, so the process
# verifying a receipt has to resolve the same lane worker the process that
# wrote it resolved. That makes BAMTS_SUITE_COMPILER_ADAPTER load-bearing at
# verification time, not only at capture time: without it, `ledger rebuild`
# resolves the harness, the receipt names the worker, and every row is
# rejected as a stale candidate binding.

# Machine-local checker (proven on this host); a portable in-repo checker is a deliberate future decision.
# Verify one outline leaf gate file without mutating it: the gate whose
# CHECK is `just leaf-gate <id>` is the leaf's recursive self-gate, so
# every other gate must already carry a checked box and non-pending
# evidence. This attests to recorded checkbox state from a prior checker
# pass, not to freshly re-run checks; the mutating checker's run of this
# recipe then supplies the self-gate's own evidence (run leaves twice:
# the first flips the body, the second converges the self-gate).
