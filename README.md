bamTiScript is a pre-release Rust toolchain that type-checks, runs, and compiles TypeScript. TypeScript 7.0.2 compatibility is in progress.

## Naming conventions

- Repository: `bamTiScript`
- CLI binary: `bamts`
- Workspace crates: `bamts`, `bamts-cli`, `bamts-compiler`, `bamts-cancel`, `bamts-bytecode`, `bamts-runtime`, `bamts-codegen`, `bamts-native`, `bamts-node`, `bamts-verification`, and private `bamts-napi`
- npm packages: `bamti` (in-process Node 24+ interface) and `bamti-cli` (standalone CLI transport). Currently published 0.1.0 packages on npm do not provide native binary artifacts; the source implementation of Node-API bindings is not yet published.

## Quickstart

Build the CLI from source, create a TypeScript entrypoint, type-check it, and run it:

```bash
cargo build --release -p bamts-cli

cat > hello.ts <<'EOF'
const message: string = "hello from bamts";
process.stdout.write(`${message}\n`);
EOF

target/release/bamts check hello.ts
target/release/bamts run --target jit hello.ts
target/release/bamts compile --target aot -o hello hello.ts
./hello
```

## Project status

- Version `0.2.0` is pre-release.
- `bamti` provides an in-process Node 24+ interface backed by native Node-API bindings (`bamts-napi`) and atomic cancellation (`bamts-cancel`), while `bamti-cli` is the standalone CLI transport.
- The native addon design targets five host platform packages (`@bamti/bamti-linux-x64-gnu`, `@bamti/bamti-linux-arm64-gnu`, `@bamti/bamti-darwin-x64`, `@bamti/bamti-darwin-arm64`, `@bamti/bamti-win32-x64-msvc`) with fail-closed optional artifact loading.
- Currently published 0.1.0 npm packages do not contain prebuilt native binary artifacts. Real five-target release validation remains blocked by GitHub billing and is unverified. Build the working CLI from source with Cargo on Linux x64.
- The documented runtime target is Linux x64. AOT steps use the C compiler driver selected by `$CC`, defaulting to `cc`.
## Current capabilities

- Type checking with `text`, `pretty`, `json`, `github`, and `compact` diagnostic output
- JIT execution with `run --target jit`
- AOT execution and native binary compilation with `--target aot`
- UTF-16 code-unit indexing for ECMAScript strings
- In-process Node.js 24+ interface via native Node-API bindings (`bamts-napi`) with atomic cancellation control (`bamts-cancel`)
- A limited Node-style host surface that includes `process.stdout.write`
## Explicit limitations

- TypeScript 7.0.2 is the compatibility oracle and target, not a completed compatibility claim.
- `compile` accepts one entrypoint per invocation and only the AOT target. `-o` selects the output path. Declaration generation and source-map output are rejected.
- `bamti` requires Node.js 24 or later. Currently published `0.1.0` npm packages do not contain compiled native artifacts; the source-tree native addon implementation is unpublished.
- `bamti` optional native package loading is fail-closed. Real five-target runtime release verification is blocked by GitHub billing and has not passed.
- The host runtime implements a limited Node-style API surface. It does not provide full Node.js compatibility.
- AOT output targets the host architecture. Cross-compilation and non-Linux runtime behavior are not verified.
- The root workspace policy defaults to `unsafe_code = "forbid"`. Most crates inherit it. Native code generation, host export, verification, FFI, and private `bamts-napi` crates contain narrowly scoped, documented exceptions. This policy is not an end-to-end formal memory-safety guarantee.
- The project publishes no performance benchmark or production-readiness claim.
- Formal source artifacts target named properties. The current acceptance state is recorded in the proof ledger; complete compiler and runtime correctness is not proven.
