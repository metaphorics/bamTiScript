//! Control-flow narrowing and contextual typing over the interned
//! [`TypeTable`].
//!
//! The module has three layers, all driven by an outside caller (a future
//! statement-level flow pass); nothing here walks statements on its own.
//!
//! - **Flow facts.** A [`NarrowingContext`] owns an arena of flow frames.
//!   [`NarrowingContext::branch`] forks a frame, [`NarrowingContext::join`]
//!   merges forked frames back into their common parent by unioning the
//!   per-branch refinements, and [`NarrowingContext::type_at`] resolves the
//!   effective type of a [`FlowKey`] at one program point. Facts are keyed by
//!   *reference* — a rooted property path (`shape.kind`), not just a symbol —
//!   so discriminated-union member accesses narrow independently of their
//!   root.
//! - **Discriminant narrowing.** [`NarrowingGuard`] is the closed set of
//!   conditions the syntax layer can prove from a guard expression:
//!   `typeof`, `instanceof`, `in`, equality against a literal, and bare
//!   truthiness. [`NarrowingContext::guards_from`] extracts them from an
//!   [`Expr`] through the caller-supplied [`GuardResolver`] seam (the checker
//!   owns symbol resolution and expression typing; this module owns the
//!   control-flow logic). Each guard maps to one total algebra operation:
//!   [`NarrowingContext::narrow_typeof`], [`NarrowingContext::narrow_in`],
//!   [`NarrowingContext::narrow_equality`],
//!   [`NarrowingContext::narrow_instanceof`],
//!   [`NarrowingContext::narrow_truthiness`], and the union-discriminant
//!   special case [`NarrowingContext::narrow_discriminant`].
//! - **Contextual typing.** Object, array, and function literals take the
//!   type the surrounding position expects: [`NarrowingContext::contextual_property_type`]
//!   and [`NarrowingContext::contextual_element_type`] project a contextual
//!   composite into one member position, and
//!   [`NarrowingContext::contextual_function`] types a function literal
//!   against a contextual signature, filling unannotated parameters and
//!   unwrapping the awaited body return of `async` literals.
//!
//! Every operation is total. Opaque inputs — `any`, `unknown`, `error`, and
//! the nominal [`Type::Named`] / generic [`Type::Object`] members whose
//! runtime shape this closed type space cannot see — are never refined away:
//! they pass through both polarities of every narrowing unchanged, so one
//! unresolvable input never collapses a fact to `never`. When no guard
//! applies, the result is the input type unchanged.
