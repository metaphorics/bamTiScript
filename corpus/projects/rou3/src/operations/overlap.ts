/**
 * Compare two route patterns by the sets of concrete paths they match. Pure
 * and router-free, like {@link routesOverlap}, but answers containment as well
 * as intersection:
 *
 * - `"disjoint"` — no concrete path matches both (proven).
 * - `"equal"` — both match exactly the same paths (proven; param *names*
 *   don't matter: `/a/:x` equals `/a/:y`, `/u/:id(\d+)` equals `/u/:x(\d+)`).
 * - `"superset"` — `patternA` provably matches every path `patternB` matches,
 *   and the reverse could not be proven (strict unless equality is
 *   undecidable).
 * - `"subset"` — the mirror image (`patternA` ⊆ `patternB`).
 * - `"partial"` — neither containment could be proven and the match-sets
 *   *may* intersect.
 *
 * Every verdict's containment claims are proofs; what is *not* guaranteed is
 * exhaustiveness of the undecidable directions, which always degrade toward a
 * weaker verdict, never a wrong claim:
 *
 * - Two regex-constrained segments are only proven equal by source equality
 *   (modulo param names), and a regex only proven to cover a literal via
 *   `test()` — so `/u/:id(\d+)` vs `/u/:id([0-9]+)` reports `"partial"` even
 *   though the sets are equal.
 * - Strictness of `"superset"`/`"subset"` is best-effort: when a pair is
 *   actually equal but equality is only provable in one direction, the proven
 *   containment is reported — `/u/:id(42)` vs `/u/42` is `"superset"`, not
 *   `"equal"`.
 * - `"partial"`'s intersection half is over-approximated (like
 *   {@link routesOverlap}): a `"partial"` pair of disjoint regex constraints,
 *   e.g. `/u/:a(\d+)` vs `/u/:b([a-z]+)`, may in fact share no path.
 * - Containment of one multi-shape pattern (optional groups/modifiers) in
 *   another is proven shape-by-shape, so a subset split across several of the
 *   other pattern's alternatives may also degrade to `"partial"`.
 *
 * Patterns are expanded through rou3's own `addRoute` pipeline (groups,
 * modifiers, escaping), so the verdict is consistent with
 * `findRoute`/`findAllRoutes` by construction — e.g. `/a/:x?` is `"equal"` to
 * `/a/*` (both match `/a` and `/a/seg`).
 *
 * @example
 * compareRoutes("/api/**", "/api/admin/**"); // "superset"
 * compareRoutes("/a/:x/c", "/a/b/*"); // "partial" (ambiguous specificity)
 * compareRoutes("/a/**", "/b/**"); // "disjoint"
